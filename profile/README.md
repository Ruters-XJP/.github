# GitHub Organization: The Ruters

## 🎉🚀 Introduction

Welcome to The Ruters, a GitHub organization dedicated to the exploration and advocacy of freedom of expression through technology, with a specific focus on the peculiar yet powerful symbol of resistance: Winnie-the-Pooh. Our community consists of developers, researchers, and activists united by a common goal to challenge censorship and promote transparency worldwide, using humor as our primary tool.

## 🎯💡 Our Mission

The Ruters is committed to creating and supporting technological solutions that counteract censorship, protect individual rights, and ensure the free flow of information. Our mission is inspired by the global reaction to censorship in China, particularly the bans on imagery and mentions of Winnie-the-Pooh used in political satire related to General Secretary Xi Jinping.

## 🐻🔍 Current Projects

1. **PoohBear Watch 🧐**: This project develops tools to detect and document digital censorship, especially targeting the seemingly innocuous symbols like Winnie-the-Pooh that have become icons of resistance against oppression in various contexts. The censorship began when Chinese netizens used Pooh to satirize their leader, leading to a sweeping ban on the character in various forms of media.
2. **Xi-Pooh Memetics 🤣**: A research initiative that delves into the impact of memes in modern political discourse, studying how humorous comparisons like those between Xi Jinping and Winnie-the-Pooh can become powerful tools of political commentary and resistance.
3. **Dialogue Freedom 📢**: Focused on fostering uncensored discussions on topics that face restrictions in China and beyond, such as the Cultural Revolution, the Tiananmen Square protests, and Taiwan's political status. This platform supports open academic and public discourse, inspired by instances where discussions were curbed due to political sensitivities.
